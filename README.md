# Housing_Data_Analysis_with_Visualization

Hello! I am Hafiz Huzaifa Bin Waqas, currently studying Software Engineering at UBIT.

PROJECT: Housing Data Analysis with Visualization

DATASET: This Dataset has been taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset

STEPS: This Project consists of following steps, --> Load the Dataset --> Read the Dataset --> Compute Statistics including Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation etc. --> Data Visualization using Histogram, Histoplot, Box-And-Whiskers plot, Pie Charts etc. --> Summarizing insights from the Dataset

STORY TELLING: I have studied this Dataset which is comprised of 545 rows and 13 coloumns, and found that it contains no null values. The price of Houses ranges from 1750000-13300000, which depends on multiple factors like Area, Parking, Mainroad, Furnishing Status, Air-Conditioning etc. Most houses had 2-4 bedrooms, no parking area and are semi-furnished. But I found a few large homes priced lower than expected, possibly due to old construction or location issues. The price distribution was right-skewed, meaning a few expensive homes raised the average. Overall, the data shows a mixed market, where area plays a role but other factors matter too.

REQUIREMENTS: Housing.csv pandas, matplot, seaborn libraries
